## Multiple environments support ##

Project is able to change: request URLs, secret keys, app name, app id, etc. just in few seconds.
So we can switch between `dev`, `stage`, `prod` environments for example

### To switch environments ###
- ```yarn env:dev``` or
- ```yarn env:stage``` or
- ```yarn env:prod```, etc.
- and `re-build` app

### Libraries
- [react-native-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-config)
  - cons:
    - variables can be used in native code
  - pros:
    - complex setup
    - configs can't be changed in runtime
- [react-native-dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv)
  - cons:
    - simple setup
    - config changes doesn't require app re-build
  - pros:
    - variables can't be used in native code

I prefer `react-native-config` as we can easily change application id, name, deeplinks in native code

### Structure ###
Do not store sensitive info in the same repository with project.
Better store it in separate private repository with limited access.

Main idea: each folder contains all env-specific configs and files.
And we have script that takes files from necessary folder and puts where it 
needs to be

- üìÅ `env`
  - setup.sh
  - Readme.md
  - üìÅ `dev`
    - env
    - google-services.json
    - google-service-key.json
    - GoogleService-Info.plist
    - release.keystore
  - üìÅ `prod`
    - env
    - google-services.json
    - google-service-key.json
    - GoogleService-Info.plist
    - release.keystore
  - üìÅ `staging`
    - env
    - google-services.json
    - google-service-key.json
    - GoogleService-Info.plist
    - release.keystore

Don't forget to add following lines to the `.gitignore`
```
# react-native-config
.env
env/
```

## Environment variables
After steps above completed you should be able to fill
all these keys in `.env` file with valid data
