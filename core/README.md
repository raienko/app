# core

An [Expo](https://expo.dev) (SDK 57) app using [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for navigation, [MMKV](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) for local storage, and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) (on-device + web) for component development.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   `.env` is read by Expo CLI (via `@expo/env`) and used both by `app.config.ts` (app name/slug/scheme/bundle id) and by the app itself through [`src/constants/env`](src/constants/env/index.js). Only `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`-prefixed vars are available at runtime — Metro inlines them into the bundle at build time, so they must be referenced as a static `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_X`, never a dynamic key. See the comment in `src/constants/env/index.js` before adding new ones.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn web       # browser
   yarn ios       # iOS simulator, real dev client (see caveat below)
   yarn android   # Android emulator, real dev client
   ```

   `yarn start` also works and lets you choose a platform from the Metro CLI (`w`/`i`/`a`), but note it opens **Expo Go** by default, which cannot load native modules like `react-native-mmkv` — use `yarn ios`/`yarn android` (or `expo run:ios`/`expo run:android`) for a real dev-client build instead when you need native storage to work.

   > **iOS build caveat:** building the native dev client currently requires **Xcode 26.4+**. Expo SDK 57's `expo-modules-jsi` fails to compile on Xcode 26.0–26.3 due to a Swift 6.2 C++ interop strictness change ([expo/expo#46242](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/46242)). Web and Android are unaffected.

## Project structure

```
app.config.ts          Expo config — reads name/slug/scheme/bundleId from src/constants/env
metro.config.js         Wraps Metro with Storybook's entry-swap (see Storybook below)
src/
  app/                   Routing only (Expo Router) — each route file re-exports a screen
  root/                   Root — wraps the router; see below
  screens/<name>/        One folder per screen, index.tsx is the screen component
  components/<name>/     One folder per component: index.tsx, index.stories.tsx, index.test.tsx
  features/storage/       LocalValue<T> — a small MMKV-backed reactive value primitive
  constants/env/          Validated EXPO_PUBLIC_* env vars, used by both app code and app.config.ts
```

Every screen/component/feature-value lives in its own folder with a single `index` entry point; all imports go through that folder path (e.g. `@/components/text`), not into its internals. Components ship with a co-located Storybook story and a Jest smoke test that follows the same pattern:

```ts
import Component from "./index";

describe(`${Component.name} smoke test`, () => {
  /* ... */
});
```

### Local storage — `LocalValue`

```ts
import { LocalValue } from "@/features/storage";

const value = new LocalValue<T>("some-key");
value.getValue(); // read once
value.setValue(v); // write
value.reset(); // clear
value.use(); // reactive read inside a component — see note below
```

Backed by MMKV natively, `localStorage` (with an in-memory fallback for SSR) on web. Any component calling `.use()` needs a `"use no memo";` directive as its first line — React Compiler doesn't recognize a method call as a hook and will otherwise memoize the component and break reactivity (see the comment on `StorageValue.use()`).

### `Root` — `src/root`

Mounted once, in `src/app/_layout.tsx`, wrapping the router (`<Root><Stack /></Root>`). This is the single place for:

- context providers every screen needs (currently `SafeAreaProvider`; add state/theme/etc. providers here as they're introduced)
- global overlay UI rendered above the current screen (toasts, modals, ...)
- global listeners/services that should run for the app's lifetime (analytics init, push notification listeners, app-state listeners, ...) — wire these up here via `useEffect` once there's a concrete one to add

It's not a route or a reusable UI component — it's app composition root, kept separate from `components/` for that reason.

## Scripts

| Script                            | What it does                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn start`                      | Metro, choose platform interactively (opens Expo Go)                    |
| `yarn web` / `ios` / `android`    | Run on a given platform (ios/android build a real dev client)           |
| `yarn lint`                       | ESLint (`expo lint`)                                                    |
| `yarn typecheck`                  | `tsc --noEmit`                                                          |
| `yarn test`                       | Jest                                                                    |
| `yarn format` / `format:check`    | Prettier write / check                                                  |
| `yarn secretlint`                 | Scan the repo for committed secrets                                     |
| `yarn storybook`                  | On-device Storybook (Metro, opens on whatever device/emulator you pick) |
| `yarn storybook:ios` / `:android` | On-device Storybook, direct to one platform                             |
| `yarn storybook:web`              | Web Storybook (Vite) at `localhost:6006`                                |
| `yarn storybook:web:build`        | Build the web Storybook for static hosting                              |

## Storybook

Two separate setups, both driven by the same `*.stories.tsx` files under `src/`:

- **On-device** (`.rnstorybook/`): `yarn storybook[:ios|:android]` sets `STORYBOOK_ENABLED=true`, which makes `metro.config.js` swap the app's entry point for the Storybook UI — the regular `yarn ios`/`yarn android`/`yarn web` builds are unaffected when the flag isn't set.
- **Web** (`.storybook/`): a separate Vite-based build (`@storybook/react-native-web-vite`), since MMKV doesn't exist on web. `.env` is loaded manually here (Vite doesn't do Expo's env inlining) — see the `viteFinal` hook in `.storybook/main.ts`.

## Git hooks

Set up via [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged), rooted at the repo root's `.git` even though `package.json` lives in this `core/` subdirectory (see `prepare` script and `core/.husky/`).

- **pre-commit**: formats and lints staged files, and scans staged files for secrets ([secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)).
- **pre-push**: full `lint` + `typecheck` + `test`.
