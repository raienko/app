# core

An [Expo](https://expo.dev) (SDK 57) app using [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for navigation, [MMKV](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) for local storage, and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) (on-device + web) for component development.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   `.env` is read by Expo CLI (via `@expo/env`) and used both by `app.config.ts` (app name/slug/scheme/bundle id) and by the app itself through [`src/constants/env`](src/constants/env/index.js). Only `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`-prefixed vars are available at runtime — Metro inlines them into the bundle at build time, so they must be referenced as a static `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_X`, never a dynamic key. See the comment in `src/constants/env/index.js` before adding new ones.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn web       # browser
   yarn ios       # iOS simulator, real dev client (see caveat below)
   yarn android   # Android emulator, real dev client
   ```

   `yarn start` also works and lets you choose a platform from the Metro CLI (`w`/`i`/`a`), but note it opens **Expo Go** by default, which cannot load native modules like `react-native-mmkv` — use `yarn ios`/`yarn android` (or `expo run:ios`/`expo run:android`) for a real dev-client build instead when you need native storage to work.

   > **iOS build caveat:** building the native dev client currently requires **Xcode 26.4+**. Expo SDK 57's `expo-modules-jsi` fails to compile on Xcode 26.0–26.3 due to a Swift 6.2 C++ interop strictness change ([expo/expo#46242](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/46242)). Web and Android are unaffected.

## Project structure

```
app.config.ts          Expo config — reads name/slug/scheme/bundleId from src/constants/env
metro.config.js         Wraps Metro with Storybook's entry-swap (see Storybook below)
src/
  app/                   Routing only (Expo Router) — each route file re-exports a screen
  root/                   Root — wraps the router; see below
  screens/<name>/        One folder per screen, index.tsx is the screen component
  components/<name>/     One folder per component: index.tsx, index.stories.tsx, index.test.tsx
  features/storage/       LocalValue<T> — a small MMKV-backed reactive value primitive
  constants/env/          Validated EXPO_PUBLIC_* env vars, used by both app code and app.config.ts
```

Every screen/component/feature-value lives in its own folder with a single `index` entry point; all imports go through that folder path (e.g. `@/components/text`), not into its internals. Components ship with a co-located Storybook story and a Jest smoke test that follows the same pattern:

```ts
import Component from "./index";

describe(`${Component.name} smoke test`, () => {
  /* ... */
});
```

### Local storage — `LocalValue`

```ts
import { LocalValue } from "@/features/storage";

const value = new LocalValue<T>("some-key");
value.getValue(); // read once
value.setValue(v); // write
value.reset(); // clear
value.use(); // reactive read inside a component — see note below
```

Backed by MMKV natively, `localStorage` (with an in-memory fallback for SSR) on web. Any component calling `.use()` needs a `"use no memo";` directive as its first line — React Compiler doesn't recognize a method call as a hook and will otherwise memoize the component and break reactivity (see the comment on `StorageValue.use()`).

### Theme — `src/features/theme`

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@/features/theme";

const theme = useTheme(); // { scheme, colors, preference, setPreference }
```

- `scheme` — the resolved `"light" | "dark"` actually in effect.
- `preference` — what the user picked: `"light" | "dark" | "system"` (default `"system"`), persisted via `LocalValue` so it survives restarts. `setPreference` updates it.
- When `preference` is `"system"`, `scheme` tracks the OS setting live via React Native's `useColorScheme()` — no reload needed, verified by flipping the emulated OS scheme at runtime.
- `colors` — the current palette (`ThemeColors`: `background`, `text`, `textSecondary`, `backgroundElement`, `backgroundElementSelected`), sourced from [`palette.json`](src/features/theme/palette.json). Swap that file for a rebrand/different palette without touching any other file — `colors.ts` validates both `light` and `dark` have every required key and throws a clear error naming the missing one otherwise. (It's `palette.json`, not `colors.json` — Metro and Vite disagree on `.ts` vs `.json` priority for a bare `./colors` specifier, so a same-basename pair resolves to the wrong file depending on which bundler is running; keep the JSON's basename different from `colors.ts`.)

`ThemeProvider` and a `ThemeSwitcher` component (`src/components/theme-switcher`, wired into the Home screen) are both included; `Text`, `Screen`, and `Icon` (default `color`) already consume `theme.colors`.

### Responsive units — `src/features/responsive`

```tsx
import { useBreakpoint, useUnits } from "@/features/responsive";

const units = useUnits();
const breakpoint = useBreakpoint(); // "phone" | "foldable" | "tablet" | "desktop"

<View style={{ padding: units(12) }} />; // 12 in Figma is units(12)
```

- `useUnits()` scales a Figma px value for the current device: near-1:1 on a base-width phone (375px, configurable in `config.ts`), scaling up moderately (not linearly — see `SCALE_MODERATION`) and clamped (`MIN_SCALE`/`MAX_SCALE`) so values don't blow up on tablet/desktop.
- Reactive via `useWindowDimensions()` — updates live on rotation, a foldable unfolding, or a browser/desktop resize, verified by resizing the emulated viewport at runtime without navigating away (375 → 768 → 1280 → 2560px; `units(12)` went 12 → 18 → 19 → 19px, confirming both the moderated scale-up and the clamp holding at very wide desktop sizes).
- Scales off `Math.min(width, height)` — the shorter edge — not raw width, so rotating a device doesn't change its values: a phone isn't physically bigger sideways. Verified live: `375×812` portrait and `812×375` landscape both give `units(12) = 12px`; a genuinely bigger screen (`1200×800`) correctly gives `19px`.
- Memoized on the _derived scale factor_, not the raw width/height — two sizes that clamp to the same scale (e.g. 1280px and 2560px both hit `MAX_SCALE`) produce the same `units` function reference, so a `useMemo`/`createStyles()` depending on it won't recompute for a resize that wouldn't change any actual output value.
- Because it's reactive, a `units()`-based style can't live in a module-scope `StyleSheet.create` (that only runs once). Compute those inside the component instead, e.g. `useMemo(() => StyleSheet.create({ padding: units(12) }), [units])`.
- `useBreakpoint()` classifies the current width into `"phone" | "foldable" | "tablet" | "desktop"` — thresholds in `config.ts` (768 deliberately reads as `"tablet"`, matching the common iPad-portrait/`md` breakpoint, not `"foldable"`).

**Using units outside a component.** There's also a plain, non-hook `unitsSnapshot(value)`, for module scope, utility functions, or anywhere a hook isn't available:

```ts
import { unitsSnapshot } from "@/features/responsive";

const styles = StyleSheet.create({ padding: unitsSnapshot(16) }); // module scope, no hook
```

It reads `Dimensions.get("window")` imperatively at call time rather than subscribing via `useWindowDimensions()`, so it's a **snapshot, not reactive** — verified directly: called at a 900px width it correctly returned `unitsSnapshot(16) = 26`, but after resizing to 375px _without reloading_, that same module-scope value stayed frozen at `26` (it's only ever recomputed if the surrounding code re-runs, which module-scope code doesn't). Use `useUnits()` inside a component whenever the value needs to track live resizes.

It's named `unitsSnapshot`, not `units`, on purpose, and `eslint.config.js` bans importing it from anywhere under `src/components/`, `src/screens/`, or `src/root/` — verified directly (a scratch file importing it there fails lint; the same import from `src/features/` passes). Inside a component "units" should only ever mean the reactive value from `useUnits()`; reaching for the snapshot there is a lint error now, not a silent stale-value bug.

**Defining a style sheet outside the component, reactively.** `createStyles()` turns a factory into a hook — the factory is a plain function you write next to (or below) the component, and calling the hook it returns gives you fully reactive styles inside the component:

```tsx
import { StyleSheet, Text } from "react-native";
import { createStyles } from "@/features/responsive";

function Component() {
  const styles = useStyles();
  return <Text style={styles.text} />;
}

const useStyles = createStyles(({ units, breakpoint }) =>
  StyleSheet.create({
    text: { fontSize: units(14) },
  }),
);
```

The factory receives the same reactive `units`/`breakpoint` as the hooks, and the result is memoized (only recomputed when they actually change). `Button` and `Screen` both use this. Verified live: resizing 375px → 768px without reloading grew both `Screen`'s padding and `Button`'s size in the same frame, exactly as before this refactor.

- `createUnits(width)` / `getBreakpoint(width)` are the underlying pure functions (what the hooks call after reading `useWindowDimensions()`) — used directly in `units.test.ts`/`breakpoint.test.ts`, no component rendering needed.

### `Icon` — `src/components/icon`

```tsx
import Icon from "@/components/icon";

<Icon type="Feather" name="home" color="red" size={units(24)} />;
<Icon type="custom" name="logo" size={units(24)} />;
<Icon name="home" />; // type omitted -> the default family (Feather)
```

Wraps five [`@react-native-vector-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/react-native-vector-icons) families — `Feather`, `MaterialIcons`, `Ionicons`, `FontAwesome6`, `AntDesign` — plus a `"custom"` type for SVG icons defined in `custom-icons.tsx` (built with `react-native-svg`, no asset-file transform needed).

- **`name` autocompletes to the real glyph names for whichever `type` you pick**, and a name that doesn't exist for that type is a type error — not from a hand-written list, but from each package's own generated `<Family>IconName` union (`keyof typeof glyphMap`), which is also how it stays correct if a package updates its glyph set. Verified directly: `tsc` accepts `<Icon type="Feather" name="home" />` and rejects (with `@ts-expect-error`) a MaterialIcons-only name passed with `type="MaterialIcons"`, a Feather name passed to `type="custom"`, and vice versa — four independent, genuine type errors, not just "it compiles."
- **Default type is one constant**: `DEFAULT_ICON_TYPE` in `index.tsx`. Change it there and `<Icon name="..." />` (type omitted) switches which family's names it expects — no other file changes.
- **`color` defaults to `theme.colors.text`** — pass it explicitly to override, same as `size`. This is what makes an icon with no `color` prop legible in both themes automatically instead of defaulting to the underlying library's black. Verified both ways live in-browser: the Home screen's `<Icon type="Feather" name="home" size={units(20)} />` (no `color`) renders white in dark mode and black in light mode, tracking `theme.colors.text` with no reload; a `color="red"` override stays red in both.
- Every family needs its font registered on iOS — each `@react-native-vector-icons/*` package ships its own Expo config plugin (adds the font to `Info.plist`), listed in `app.config.ts`'s `plugins`.
- Verified rendering on web: all 5 vector families with distinct glyphs, the custom SVG icon, and the omitted-`type` default all confirmed visually in-browser. Before the theme-default-color above, several of these icon families defaulted to **black** — invisible against this app's dark-mode `Screen` background unless you passed an explicit `color`; the theme default now makes that the non-issue it should be.
- Adding a new vector family or a new custom icon is one line each in `icon-sets.ts` / `custom-icons.tsx` — nothing else needs to change.

### `Root` — `src/root`

```
src/root/
  index.tsx       Root — mounted once in src/app/_layout.tsx: <Root><Stack /></Root>
  providers.tsx    Providers — every context provider (safe area, theme, ...)
  testing.tsx       render()/screen/etc. wrapping Providers, for tests
```

`Root` wraps `Providers` and is the single place for:

- context providers every screen needs — add a new one to `providers.tsx` only
- global overlay UI rendered above the current screen (toasts, modals, ...)
- global listeners/services that should run for the app's lifetime (analytics init, push notification listeners, app-state listeners, ...) — wire these up here via `useEffect` once there's a concrete one to add

**Providers are centralized on purpose.** Both Storybook preview configs (`.storybook/preview.tsx`, `.rnstorybook/preview.tsx`) decorate every story with `<Providers>`, and every component test imports `render`/`screen`/etc. from `@/root/testing` instead of `@testing-library/react-native` directly:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from "@/root/testing";
```

That `render` is a drop-in replacement that already wraps the tree in `Providers`. Adding a new provider in `providers.tsx` — a state provider, an auth provider, whatever comes next — makes it available to the real app, every Storybook story, and every test's `render()` in one edit; no per-file changes needed. (`src/root/index.test.tsx` is the one exception — it tests `Root` itself, so it renders unwrapped, via `@testing-library/react-native` directly.)

It's not a route or a reusable UI component — it's app composition root, kept separate from `components/` for that reason.

| `yarn storybook:web:build`        | Build the web Storybook for static hosting                              |

## Storybook

Two separate setups, both driven by the same `*.stories.tsx` files under `src/`:

- **On-device** (`.rnstorybook/`): `yarn storybook[:ios|:android]` sets `STORYBOOK_ENABLED=true`, which makes `metro.config.js` swap the app's entry point for the Storybook UI — the regular `yarn ios`/`yarn android`/`yarn web` builds are unaffected when the flag isn't set.
- **Web** (`.storybook/`): a separate Vite-based build (`@storybook/react-native-web-vite`), since MMKV doesn't exist on web. `.env` is loaded manually here (Vite doesn't do Expo's env inlining) — see the `viteFinal` hook in `.storybook/main.ts`.

## Git hooks

Set up via [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged), rooted at the repo root's `.git` even though `package.json` lives in this `core/` subdirectory (see `prepare` script and `core/.husky/`).

- **pre-commit**: formats and lints staged files, and scans staged files for secrets ([secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint)).
- **pre-push**: full `lint` + `typecheck` + `test`.
